# QC Questions on Java Basics
 - What is Java?
    - Object-Oriented: Java uses objects and classes to organize code, making it easier to manage and reuse.
    - Platform-Independent: Java code runs on the JVM, making it portable across different operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux).

 - Pillars of OOP
    - Abstraction : the concept of hiding / Contract  by using abstract(extends) and Interface(Implements)
    - Polymorphism : Many form -> overloading(dif parameter same name) and overriding (same everything)
    - Inheritance :  Parent -> child 
    - Encasulation :  technique to make data as "one unit" -> by making var private / protected

 - Define Abstraction
   - Abstraction simplifies a complex system by showing only the essential attributes and behaviors, while hiding unnecessary detail:
      - Abstract Classes: Classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and may contain abstract methods (methods without a body).
      - Interfaces: Define a contract of methods that a class must implement.

 - Define Polymorphism
   - Many Forms -> Involves changing the behavior of a method through overriding and overloading:
      - Method Overriding (Run-time Polymorphism): same method name , same paramaeter usually the changes happen in the subclass
      - Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism) : same name  but different parameter 

 - Define Inheritance
   -  Inheritance allows you to use the code written in one class in another class without having to rewrite it.
   - Inheritance in Java is implemented using: 
      - "extends"


 - Define Encapsulation
   -  It refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit:
      - Making the fields (data) private
      - Providing public getter and setter methods
